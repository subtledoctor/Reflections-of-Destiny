
TO DO Reflections

for v4.3:

*****
- remove critical campaign choice from the Belt DLG
- after killing Sarevok, dukes talk about Caelar
 -- are they connected?
 -- is it another Bhaalspawn?
 -- what's her deal, anyway?
- they give you an information-gathering quest
 -- her uncle lives here... a wreck of a man, but maybe he has useful information
 -- go talk to him
 -- ...or say, sure, but I'll get to it when I get to it
- quest: you find the Argent but there is a kidnapping attempt!
 -- some dialogue with ringleader
 -- you find out a bunch of refugees are being driven toward the city
 -- *they* find out what you are (maybe it is discernable in your aura after killing Sarevok)
 -- "things are accelerating faster than she feared! another Bhaalspawn in the upper echelons of the city's government!"
 -- leader teleports away and you battle his minions
- report back to the dukes, *then* have the critical choice

- "use the crystal!" ...argent glows blue, charname glows purple-black
 -- other party members glow as well? lighter? pink?
 -- make a ghostly image of Sarevok appear
 -- "do you see - ? it's not just one!" "how is that possible?" "it doesn't matter. I must report to Caelar. Subdue the godspawn. do what you can."

for v5:

*****
- rewrite SoD plot
 -- CA is descended from Zariel
 -- CA has been told she will meet Zariel, that Zariel will help her subdue the Sword Coast
  --- thinks Zariel wants to prevent the chaos of the Bhaalspawn
 -- CA opens the gate thinking it will allow Zariel to come to the Prime and be redeemed
  --- but of course Zariel does not give a crap, doesn't know or care that CA exists
- how does CA open the portal? does she need something from Charname?
 -- need to come up with something substantially better than blood
  --- maybe it's she activates Sarevok's sword with Charname's blood?
- tie in the trip to the castle basement?
 -- it's a trap! 
  --- which means whoever gives that quest is a traitor...!
 -- they take something from Charname
 -- something about Charname and Sarevok being entwined
  --- S was the first to kill another Bhaalspawn; CN is the second
  --- and Sarevok's death happened in a temple prepared by rituals
  --- so CN somehow carries part of S's soul
  --- because S wanted to take CN's 
  
CA thought Zariel would appear and assist her to take control; instead the portal is opened and CA gets sucked into Avernus.
She makes demands that Belhifet introduce her to Zariel; he dispels her delusion. 
Of course he very much wants to take over the Sword Coast, and he is able and willing to stamp out the Bhaalspawn. 
He makes that offer to her: give her what she wants, just not the way she wants it. 
But it WILL prevent chaos, and unnecessary death (only, Belhifet would be the arbiter of which deaths are 'necessary.')
So she must make a choice: promise to serve, and attain her goal? Or rebel against him and let her efforts be wasted?
This is a harder choice than it would seem - 
Service and attainment of goals are in her nature, as is the rule of law.
Rebellion, and failure, are completely alien to her.
